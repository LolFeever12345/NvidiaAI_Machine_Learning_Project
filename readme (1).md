Weapon Detection Algorithm Through Machine Learning Algorithm

This project that I built used the jetson-inference library and python scripts from that library to train and develop a machine learning model that could detect if weapons or other suspicious objects were in a stream, these include guns and knives as well as suspicously thick body armour like kevlar vests and other items.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm that I used was from the python script that jetson-inferenced used for more info on the training algorithm I used click this link (https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/tree/master)

## Running this project

1. First download the model onto your Nano and then
